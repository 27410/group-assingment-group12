# 27410 - Group assignment - Group [Group Number] - [TITLE]

> Dear students, thank you for accepting the group assignment. Please fill in the
> requested information below and above ([Group Number] and [TITLE]) and remove this quoted part before submission (everything prepended with a >).
> Please also replace `[PUT-YOUR-REPOSITORY-HERE]` up in the first line 👆 with the name of your repository here on GitHub.
> That way someone can click on the Binder badge icon and open your project in Jupyter lab to explore it.
> For this to work you will also have to keep `requirements.txt` up to date (by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
> Furthermore, this will only work if you decide to make your repository public (which you can do under Settings -> Options),
> which I would encourage you to do – up to you. A lot of good science happens out in the open these days.
> Good luck!

## Project summary (<300 words)
Describe the overall aim of your project and what you have achieved.

## Project overview
The project is organized by the numbered Junyper notebooks, beginning with 1. Memote to 6. Flux Variance Analysis. Furthermore, there are the important files model_methods.py and iNF517.xml that are the function where we get the updated model from the model validation and the initial model respectively. The "Report" Jupyter notebook is our main document, with all our findings, discussions and conclusions.
